## Free Code Camp Projectâ€”Timestamp Microservice

This repository was created in fulfilment of the Timestamp Microservice project of the Free Code Camp Curriculum.  [Glitch](https://glitch.com/about) was used for the entire process.  In-browser data retrieval was tested on the latest version of Chrome, Firefox and Safari at the time of writing.  A demo of the project is available [here](https://honmanyau-timestamp-api.glitch.me).
